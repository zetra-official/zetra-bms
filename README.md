## 🏗 Architecture Philosophy (DORA v1)

ZETRA BMS follows a strict architectural doctrine:

- Database is the single source of truth  
- Business logic lives in PostgreSQL (RPC-driven design)  
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforced at DB level  
- No duplicated logic in frontend  
- Security-first profit handling (owner-only visibility)  
- Canonical schema enforcement  
- Clean, version-controlled workflow  

This ensures:

- Stability  
- Security  
- Scalability  
- Production-grade integrity
